**What I plan on storing**

-Your Username

-Your Discord ID (The numbers that come after your username)

-That's it!

There is an example of what a .user file looks like in the src/data directory, your username and ID are stored by the file in the filename in a {username}#{discordtag}.user format. I will use Jade Bot to advertise any changes to her storage policy, as well as delete all prior data.


Your messages will be processed to determine XP but this exists (to my knowledge) only as long as it takes to process it, it is then removed from memory. (It is ofcourse, still logged by Discord)


Data from #mod-log is not stored by Jade Bot, and only exists in jadebot as long as it takes to post it in a #mod-log chat.

Considering that Jade Bot is MIT licenced and nobody is obligated to share any changes they create, different hosts may create modifications to Jade Bot that cannot be audited and they may store additional data not mentioned here or otherwise completely contradict what I promised. If you do not trust me or others, simply consider hosting Jade Bot yourself to ensure nobody has access to information you do not want shared.
