Because I'm a stupid dumb idiot currently, please manually use install the gems 'discordrb', 'redis', and 'json' using `gem install`, a proper `bundle install` will come shortly as I figure out how to work out bundle. You must also be running a redis server(she is being on developed on 4.0.2, but older versions "Should" work). if you would like to how correct "the RP" of jadebot, please either make a pull request with your suggestions altered in with an explaination in the pull request or leave a bug report with your suggestions.
